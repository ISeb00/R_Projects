# R_Projects
Projects for BIOL 668 R module

1. RProjectPt1 - uses RTestData-1.txt
> Part A performs multivariate statistics analyses like data transformations and normality plots, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation tests, and linear regression models. Part B explores use of the ggplot library, creating histograms, scatter plots, and using smoothing algorithms. Part C uses the vegan library to calculate alpha diversity, rarefy data and generate rarefaction curves, calculate Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices, and create multidimensional scaling plots.
2. RProjectPt2 - uses grassland.community.csv, grassland.phylogeny.newick, plot.metadata.csv, and species.traits.csv
> This notebook performs a myriad of biodiversity analyses using community and traits data, along with metadata and phylogeny. It visualizes community richness and diversity and then moves on to multivariate community analyses with heirarchical clustering and ordination. Phylogenetic signal is used to monitor trait evolution and relationships. Phylogenetic relatedness is explored using Faith's PD index and SES(MPD) and SES(MNTD). The last tests look at phylogenetic beta-diversity.
